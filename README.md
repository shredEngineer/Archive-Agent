# 🧠 Archive Agent

**Archive Agent** tracks your files, syncs changes, and powers smart queries.  

*Watch me explain it here:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyKovjez4-g

![Archive Agent Logo](archive_agent/assets/Archive-Agent-400x300.png)

**Archive Agent** is a **Smart Indexer with [RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) Engine**, using this tech stack:

- **MCP server for automation through IDE or AI extension**
- Fast and effective semantic chunking (**smart chunking**)
- Qdrant vector DB *(running locally)* for storage and search 
- OpenAI API for embeddings and queries
  ([more providers coming soon](https://github.com/shredEngineer/Archive-Agent/issues/6))
- Command-line interface (CLI) using *Typer*
- Graphical user interface (GUI) using *Streamlit*

## ⚙️ Install Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) *(for running Qdrant server)*
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) **>= 3.10, < 3.13** *(core runtime)*
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) *(dependency management)*


- **Tested with Ubuntu 24.04**


- Experimental [install instructions for Mac OS X](macos.md) are available.

## ⚙️ Export OpenAI API key

To export your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), replace `sk-...` with your actual key and run this once:

```bash
echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

This will persist the export for the current user.

**NOTE:** Embeddings and queries will incur AI API token costs. **Use at your own risk.**

💡 **Good to know:** [OpenAI won't use your data for training.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/your-data)

---

## ⚙️ Install Archive Agent

To install **Archive Agent** in the current directory of your choice, run this once:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shredEngineer/Archive-Agent
cd Archive-Agent
poetry install
poetry run python -m spacy download xx_sent_ud_sm
sudo apt install -y pandoc python3-tk
chmod +x *.sh
echo "alias archive-agent='$(pwd)/archive-agent.sh'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

This will create a global `archive-agent` command for the current user.

📌 **Note:** Complete Qdrant server setup **before** using the `archive-agent` command.

---

## ⚙️ Setup Qdrant server

🚨 **IMPORTANT:** To manage Docker without root, run this once **and reboot**:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

To launch Qdrant with persistent storage and auto-restart, run this once:

```bash
./ensure-qdrant.sh
```

This will download the Qdrant docker image on the first run.

## 🧠 How Archive Agent works

### ℹ️ Which files are processed

**Archive Agent** currently supports these file types:
- Text:
  - Plaintext: `.txt`, `.md`
  - Documents:
    - ASCII documents: `.html`, `.htm`
    - Binary documents: `.odt`, `.docx` (including images)
  - PDF documents: `.pdf` (including images, see note below)
- Images: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.bmp`

📌 **Note:** Customize how PDF pages are handled in the [Archive Agent settings](#-archive-agent-settings):

- Strict OCR mode **disabled** (default):
  - OCR text layer is extracted.
  - Forground images are decoded,  background images are ignored.
  - Cheap and fast, but less accurate.

- Strict OCR mode **enabled**:
  - OCR text layer is ignored.
  - PDF pages are treated as images.
  - Expensive and slow, but more accurate.

### ℹ️ How files are processed

Ultimately, **Archive Agent** decodes everything to text like this:
- Plaintext files are decoded to UTF-8.
- Documents are converted to plaintext, images are extracted.
- PDF documents are decoded according to strict OCR mode setting.
- Images are decoded to text using AI vision.
  - The vision model will reject unintelligible images.

Using *Pandoc* for documents, *PyMuPDF4LLM* for PDFs, *Pillow* for images.

📌 **Note:** Unsupported files are tracked but not processed.

### ℹ️ How smart chunking works

**Archive Agent** processes decoded text like this:
- Decoded text is sanitized and split into sentences.
- Sentences are grouped into reasonably-sized blocks.
- **Each block is split into smaller chunks using an AI model.**
  - Block boundaries are handled gracefully (last chunk carries over).
- Each chunk is turned into a vector using AI embeddings.
- Each vector is turned into a *point* with file metadata.
- Each *point* is stored in the Qdrant database.

💡 **Good to know:** This **smart chunking** improves the accuracy and effectiveness of the retrieval. 

### ℹ️ How chunks are retrieved

**Archive Agent** retrieves chunks related to your question like this:
- The question is turned into a vector using AI embeddings.
- Points with similar vectors are retrieved from the Qdrant database.
- Chunks of points with sufficient score are returned.

**Archive Agent** answers your question using retrieved chunks like this:
- The LLM receives the retrieved chunks as context to the question.
- The LLM's answer is returned and formatted.

The LLM's answer is structured to be multi-faceted, making **Archive Agent** a helpful assistant.

### ℹ️ How files are selected for tracking

**Archive Agent** uses *patterns* to select your files:

- Patterns can be actual file paths.
- Patterns can be paths containing wildcards that resolve to actual file paths.
- Patterns must be specified as (or resolve to) *absolute* paths, e.g. `/home/user/Documents/*.txt` (or `~/Documents/*.txt`).
- Patterns may use the wildcard `**` to match any files and zero or more directories, subdirectories, and symbolic links to directories.

There are *included patterns* and *excluded patterns*:

- The set of resolved excluded files is removed from the set of resolved included files.
- Only the remaining set of files (included but not excluded) is tracked by **Archive Agent**. 
- Hidden files are always ignored!

This approach gives you the best control over the specific files or file types to track.

## 🐞 Known bugs

- [ ] While `track` initially reports a file as *added*, subsequent `track` calls report it as *changed*. 


- [ ] Removing and restoring a tracked file in the tracking phase is currently not handled properly:
  - Removing a tracked file sets `{size=0, mtime=0, diff=removed}`.
  - Restoring a tracked file sets `{size=X, mtime=Y, diff=added}`.
  - Because `size` and `mtime` were cleared, we lost the information to detect a restored file.
