# 1. Ensure the virtual environment is synced (installs dependencies including dev extras).
#    IMPORTANT: uv sync will remove any packages not declared in pyproject.toml, including spacy data models downloaded separately.

# 2. Download Spacy model. This MUST be done *after* uv sync, as uv sync would have uninstalled it if it was present.
#    The uv run here ensures it's run within the project's environment.
