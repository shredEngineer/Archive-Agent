## Supported OS

**Archive Agent** has been tested with these configurations:

- **Ubuntu 24.04** (PC x64)

If you've successfully installed and tested **Archive Agent** with a different setup, please let me know and I'll add it here! 

---

## Install Archive Agent

Please install these requirements before proceeding:

- üê≥ [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) *(for running Qdrant server)*
- üêç [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) **>= 3.10** *(core runtime)* (usually already installed)

### Ubuntu / Linux Mint

This installation method should work on any Linux distribution derived from Ubuntu (e.g. Linux Mint). 

To install **Archive Agent** in the current directory of your choice, run this once:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shredEngineer/Archive-Agent
cd Archive-Agent
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The `install.sh` script will execute the following steps in order:
- Download and install `uv` (used for Python environment management)
- Install the custom Python environment
- Install the `spaCy` tokenizer model (used for chunking)
- Install `pandoc` (used for document parsing)
- Download and install the Qdrant docker image with persistent storage and auto-restart
- Install a global `archive-agent` command for the current user

üöÄ **Archive Agent is now installed!**

üëâ **Please complete the [AI provider setup](#ai-provider-setup) next.**  
(Afterward, you'll be ready to [Run Archive Agent](#run-archive-agent)!)

---

## AI provider setup

**Archive Agent** lets you choose between different AI providers:

- Remote APIs *(higher performance and costs, less privacy)*:
  - **OpenAI**: Requires an OpenAI API key.


- Local APIs *(lower performance and costs, best privacy)*:
  - **Ollama**: Requires Ollama running locally.
  - **LM Studio**: Requires LM Studio running locally.

üí° **Good to know:** You will be prompted to choose an AI provider at startup; see: [Run Archive Agent](#run-archive-agent).

üìå **Note:** You *can* customize the specific **models** used by the AI provider in the [Archive Agent settings](#archive-agent-settings). However, you *cannot* change the AI provider of an *existing* profile, as the embeddings will be incompatible; to choose a different AI provider, create a new profile instead.

### OpenAI provider setup

If the OpenAI provider is selected, **Archive Agent** requires the OpenAI API key.

To export your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), replace `sk-...` with your actual key and run this once:

```bash
echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

This will persist the export for the current user.

üí° **Good to know:** [OpenAI won't use your data for training.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/your-data)

### Ollama provider setup

If the Ollama provider is selected, **Archive Agent** requires Ollama running at `http://localhost:11434`.

- [How to install Ollama.](https://ollama.com/download)

With the default [Archive Agent Settings](#archive-agent-settings), these Ollama models are expected to be installed: 

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b             # for chunk/query
ollama pull llava:7b-v1.6           # for vision
ollama pull nomic-embed-text:v1.5   # for embed
```

üí° **Good to know:** Ollama also works without a GPU.
At least 32 GiB RAM is recommended for smooth performance.

### LM Studio provider setup

If the LM Studio provider is selected, **Archive Agent** requires LM Studio running at `http://localhost:1234`.

- [How to install LM Studio.](https://lmstudio.ai/download)

With the default [Archive Agent Settings](#archive-agent-settings), these LM Studio models are expected to be installed: 

```bash
meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct              # for chunk/query
llava-v1.5-7b                           # for vision
text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5    # for embed
```

üí° **Good to know:** LM Studio also works without a GPU.
At least 32 GiB RAM is recommended for smooth performance.

## How Archive Agent works

###  Which files are processed

**Archive Agent** currently supports these file types:
- Text:
  - Plaintext: `.txt`, `.md`
  - Documents:
    - ASCII documents: `.html`, `.htm`
    - Binary documents: `.odt`, `.docx` (including images)
  - PDF documents: `.pdf` (including images, see [OCR strategies](#ocr-strategies))
- Images: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.bmp`

### How files are processed

Ultimately, **Archive Agent** decodes everything to text like this:
- Plaintext files are decoded to UTF-8.
- Documents are converted to plaintext, images are extracted.
- PDF documents are decoded according to the OCR strategy.
- Images are decoded to text using AI vision.
  - The vision model will reject unintelligible images.

Using *Pandoc* for documents, *PyMuPDF4LLM* for PDFs, *Pillow* for images.

üìå **Note:** Unsupported files are tracked but not processed.

### OCR strategies

For PDF documents, there are different OCR strategies supported by **Archive Agent**:

- `auto` OCR strategy:
  - Selects best OCR strategy for each page based on the number of characters extracted from the PDF OCR text layer, if any. 
  - Decides based on `ocr_auto_threshold`, the minimum number of characters for `auto` OCR strategy to resolve to `relaxed` instead of `strict`.
  - **Optimal trade-off between cost, speed, and accuracy.**


- `strict` OCR strategy:
  - PDF OCR text layer is *ignored*.
  - PDF pages are treated as images.
  - **Expensive and slow, but more accurate.**


- `relaxed` OCR strategy:
  - PDF OCR text layer is extracted.
  - PDF foreground images are decoded, but background images are *ignored*.
  - **Cheap and fast, but less accurate.**


See [Archive Agent settings](#archive-agent-settings): `ocr_strategy`, `ocr_auto_threshold`

üí° **Good to know:** You will be prompted to choose an OCR strategy at startup (see [Run Archive Agent](#run-archive-agent)).

### How smart chunking works

**Archive Agent** processes decoded text like this:
- Decoded text is sanitized and split into sentences.
- Sentences are grouped into reasonably-sized blocks.
- **Each block is split into smaller chunks using an AI model.**
  - Block boundaries are handled gracefully (last chunk carries over).
- Each chunk is turned into a vector using AI embeddings.
- Each vector is turned into a *point* with file metadata.
- Each *point* is stored in the Qdrant database.

See [Archive Agent settings](#archive-agent-settings): `chunk_lines_block`

üí° **Good to know:** This **smart chunking** improves the accuracy and effectiveness of the retrieval. 

### How chunks are linked to page/line numbers

For PDFs, chunks are mapped to page number ranges (`[min]` or `[min:max]`) based on the lines they span during extraction.

For non-PDF documents, chunks are mapped to line number ranges similarly.
Mappings are mechanical per line append in loaders, but sentence splitting normalization joins paragraphs,
so ranges for sentences within a paragraph are the full paragraph's min:max (approximate sub-line mapping).
Displayed in chunk refs if available; "no page/line data" otherwise.

### How chunks are retrieved

**Archive Agent** retrieves chunks related to your question like this:
- The question is turned into a vector using AI embeddings.
- Points with similar vectors are retrieved from the Qdrant database.
- Only chunks of points with sufficient score are kept.

See [Archive Agent settings](#archive-agent-settings): `retrieve_score_min`, `retrieve_chunks_max`

### How chunks are reranked and expanded

**Archive Agent** filters the retrieved chunks .

- The retrieved chunks are reranked by relevance to your question.
- Only the top relevant chunks are kept (the other chunks are discarded).
- Each selected chunk is expanded to get a larger context from the relevant documents.

See [Archive Agent settings](#archive-agent-settings): `rerank_chunks_max`, `expand_chunks_radius`

### How answers are generated

**Archive Agent** answers your question using the reranked and expanded chunks like this:
- The LLM receives the chunks as context to the question.
- The LLM's answer is returned as structured output and formatted.

üí° **Good to know:** **Archive Agent** uses an answer template that aims to be universally helpful.

### How files are selected for tracking

**Archive Agent** uses *patterns* to select your files:

- Patterns can be actual file paths.
- Patterns can be paths containing wildcards that resolve to actual file paths.
- Patterns must be specified as (or resolve to) *absolute* paths, e.g. `/home/user/Documents/*.txt` (or `~/Documents/*.txt`).
- Patterns may use the wildcard `**` to match any files and zero or more directories, subdirectories, and symbolic links to directories.

There are *included patterns* and *excluded patterns*:

- The set of resolved excluded files is removed from the set of resolved included files.
- Only the remaining set of files (included but not excluded) is tracked by **Archive Agent**. 
- Hidden files are always ignored!

This approach gives you the best control over the specific files or file types to track.

---

## MCP Tools

**Archive Agent** exposes these tools via MCP:

| MCP tool            | Equivalent CLI command(s) | Argument(s) | Description                                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `get_patterns`      | `patterns`                | None        | Get the list of included / excluded patterns.   |
| `get_files_tracked` | `track` and then `list`   | None        | Get the list of tracked files.                  |
| `get_files_changed` | `track` and then `diff`   | None        | Get the list of changed files.                  |
| `get_search_result` | `search`                  | `question`  | Get the list of files relevant to the question. |
| `get_answer_rag`    | `query`                   | `question`  | Get answer to question using RAG.               |

üìå **Note:** These commands are **read-only**, preventing the AI from changing your Qdrant database.

üí° **Good to know:** Just type `#get_answer_rag` (e.g.) in your IDE or AI extension to call the tool directly.

---

## Update Archive Agent

This step is not needed right away if you just installed Archive Agent.
However, to get the latest features, you should update your installation regularly.

To update your **Archive Agent** installation, run this in the installation directory:

```bash
git pull
./install.sh
```

üìå **Note:** If updating doesn't work, try removing the installation directory and then [Install Archive Agent](#install-archive-agent) again.
Your config and data are safely stored in another place;
see [Archive Agent settings](#archive-agent-settings) and [Qdrant database](#qdrant-database) for details.

üí° **Good to know:** To also update the Qdrant docker image, run this:

```bash
sudo ./manage-qdrant.sh update
```

---

## Archive Agent settings

**Archive Agent** settings are organized as profile folders in `~/.archive-agent-settings/`.

E.g., the `default` profile is located in `~/.archive-agent-settings/default/`.

The currently used profile is stored in `~/.archive-agent-settings/profile.json`.

üìå **Note:** To delete a profile, simply delete the profile folder.
This will not delete the Qdrant collection (see [Qdrant database](#qdrant-database)).

### Profile configuration

The profile configuration is contained in the profile folder as `config.json`.  

üí° **Good to know:** Use the `config` CLI command to open the current profile's config (JSON) in the `nano` editor (see [Open current profile config in nano](#open-current-profile-config-in-nano)).

üí° **Good to know:** Use the `switch` CLI command to switch to a new or existing profile (see [Create or switch profile](#create-or-switch-profile)).

  | Key                    | Description                                                                                      |

### Watchlist

The profile watchlist is contained in the profile folder as `watchlist.json`.

The watchlist is managed by these commands only:

- `include` / `exclude` / `remove`
- `track` / `commit` / `update`

### AI cache

Each profile folder also contains an `ai_cache` folder.

The AI cache ensures that, in a given profile:
- The same image is only OCR-ed once.
- The same text is only chunked once.
- The same text is only embedded once.
- The same combination of chunks is only reranked once.

This way, **Archive Agent** can quickly resume where it left off if a commit was interrupted.

To bypass the AI cache for a single commit, pass the `--nocache` option to the `commit` or `update` command
(see [Commit changed files to database](#commit-changed-files-to-database) and [Combined track and commit](#combined-track-and-commit)).

üí° **Good to know:** Queries are never cached, so you always get a fresh answer. 

üìå **Note:** To clear the entire AI cache, simply delete the profile's cache folder.

üìå **Technical Note:** **Archive Agent** keys the cache using a composite hash made from the text/image bytes, and of the AI model names for chunking, embedding, reranking, and vision.
Cache keys are deterministic and change generated whenever you change the *chunking*, *embedding* or *vision* AI model names.
Since cache entries are retained forever, switching back to a prior combination of AI model names will again access the "old" keys.

## Qdrant database

The [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) database is stored in `~/.archive-agent-qdrant-storage/`.

üìå **Note:** This folder is created by the Qdrant Docker image running as root.

üí° **Good to know:** Visit your [Qdrant dashboard](http://localhost:6333/dashboard#/collections) to manage collections and snapshots.

## Developer's guide

**Archive Agent** was written from scratch for educational purposes (on either end of the software).

üí° **Good to know:** Tracking the `test_data/` gets you started with *some* kind of test data. 

### Important modules

To get started, check out these epic modules:

- Files are processed in [`archive_agent/data/FileData.py`](archive_agent/data/FileData.py)
- The app context is initialized in [`archive_agent/core/ContextManager.py`](archive_agent/core/ContextManager.py)
- The default config is defined in [`archive_agent/config/ConfigManager.py`](archive_agent/config/ConfigManager.py)  
- The CLI commands are defined in [`archive_agent/__main__.py`](archive_agent/__main__.py)
- The commit logic is implemented in [`archive_agent/core/CommitManager.py`](archive_agent/core/CommitManager.py)
- The CLI verbosity is handled in [`archive_agent/util/CliManager.py`](archive_agent/core/CliManager.py)
- The GUI is implemented in [`archive_agent/core/GuiManager.py`](archive_agent/core/GuiManager.py)
- The AI API prompts for chunking, embedding, vision, and querying are defined in [`archive_agent/ai/AiManager.py`](archive_agent/ai/AiManager.py) 
- The AI provider registry is located in [`archive_agent/ai_provider/ai_provider_registry.py`](archive_agent/ai_provider/ai_provider_registry.py)

If you miss something or spot bad patterns, feel free to contribute and refactor!

### Code testing and analysis

To run unit tests, check types, and check style, run this:

```bash
./audit.sh
```

(Some remaining type errors need to be fixed‚Ä¶)

## Known ISSUES

- [ ] While `track` initially reports a file as *added*, subsequent `track` calls report it as *changed*. 


- [ ] Removing and restoring a tracked file in the tracking phase is currently not handled properly:
  - Removing a tracked file sets `{size=0, mtime=0, diff=removed}`.
  - Restoring a tracked file sets `{size=X, mtime=Y, diff=added}`.
  - Because `size` and `mtime` were cleared, we lost the information to detect a restored file.


- [ ] AI vision is employed on empty images as well, even though they could be easily detected locally and skipped. 


- [ ] PDF vector images may not convert as expected, due to missing tests. (`strict` OCR strategy would certainly help in the meantime.) 


- [ ] Binary document page numbers (e.g., `.docx`) are not supported yet.


- [ ] Lines info in references is buggy (and only approximate due to SpaCy sentence splitting).
