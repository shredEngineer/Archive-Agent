*If only there were an app to help you uncover hidden gems in your disclosure documents…*

**I'm proud to announce Archive Agent v5.0.0, a tool to find your files with natural language and ask questions.**  

Thanks to all beta testers. Your feedback helped me to improve the usability and performance of "Archive Agent" once again.
This is a big leap forward toward better UI, improved performance, and important bugfixes.

**PS:** Unfortunately, some may have experienced image/PDF import issues with v4.3.x, now resolved in v5.0.0.
However, there's more testing than ever to do, so PLEASE share the word, contribute, and let me know what you think!
